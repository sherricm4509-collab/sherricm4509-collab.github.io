The Scottish Fold cat came from 1961 when a cat named Susie was found at a farm in Scotland. Her ears were folded at the middle and when she had kittens, two of them also had the unusual ears. It was decided that the ears came from a mutation from a simple dominant gene. The breed was then registered in 1966. <br>
The kittens that come from Scottish Fold cats that do not have folded ears are Scottish Straights. There is an incomplete dominant gene that affects the cartilage of the ears causing the fold downward. They also have large eyes and rounder heads. 
The cat is a medium to large sized cat and can come in any color. Males typically weigh 8.8-13.2 pounds and females usually weigh between 6-8.8 pounds. 
Their expressions come off as a sweet look.
