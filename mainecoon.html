Maine Coon is one of the oldest breeds in North America. They are originally from Maine and known at the “gentle giant”. They can weigh between 9 and 18 pounds but males can exceed 20 pounds. <br>
Their coats are thick and water resistant. They are large and their paws are round with little tufts of fur between the toes to help them walk on snow. <br>
Maine Coons are affectionate and dog-like cats. They make good companions and are fun to play with. They can also be trained to follow some commands and perform tricks. <br>
They do not require a lot of grooming due to them self-maintaining. They also don’t need any special diets but a high protein diet does better for them because of their larger size.
