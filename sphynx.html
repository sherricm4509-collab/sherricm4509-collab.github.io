The Sphynx cat is a hairless cat. They are famous for the lack of fur and often look like they are older with the skin showing the way it does. They typically weigh between 6 and 12 pounds. <br>
This cat can often be loving and sociable. They make great house pets and are lively and playful. On another note, they can be pretty vocal, through meows and other sounds. <br>
Because they lack fur, it is best to keep them warm and not left outside for a long period of time. They also require regular bathing because of the oil build up of their skin. They could even need sunscreen if they are out in the sun regularly. In addition to keeping up with their skin, you also have to make sure they have a good diet because a bad diet could lead to skin problems.
