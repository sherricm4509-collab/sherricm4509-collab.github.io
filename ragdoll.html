Ragdoll cats are known to follow people around and that makes them considered, dog-like cats. They are not usually aggressive to other animals and they are pretty calm natured. If you want a cat that likes to sit on your lap and play fetch, this is the cat for you. <br>
The Ragdoll cat likes to stay close to the ground as opposed to the average cat that likes to climb and be above everyone. <br>
Ragdoll cats are one of the larger cat breeds. Females are about 8-15 pounds while the male cat is 12-20 pounds. They require more brushing because their coats are long and need to be kept up with.
