Bengals come in different colors but often are portrayed in their more brown coats. In some countries, the Bengal cat has restrictions. In the US, there are some states that are restricted with the breed and they are not allowed to reside there. Some states they have to be a certain amount of generations old to be allowed. <br>
Bengal cats can be prone to Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle and makes it hard to pump blood. The life expectancy is about 8 and a half years to 11 and a half years.
